			"It will never leave you"
			Quality: 1
			A blue boomerang which can be thrown in a similar fashion to Mom's Knife, to stun any enemies it hits and deal damage
			The damage dealt by the Boomerang is equal to double your tear damage
			The boomerang can also be used to grab pickups and consumables from a distance, similar to the legend of zelda boomerang
			The range of the boomerang is affected by range, with number one the distance is very short and makes the item a lot less effective
			The Boomerang can be used to kill shopkeeper corpses, allowing you to farm their drops for coins, items, Steam Sale etc
			REPENTANCE - Boomerang is now piercing, and has far less downtime between throwing it and being able to fire tears again

      "Gold tears!"
      Quality: 2
      Every 20th tear fired will also fire a golden coin tear at the same time. This tear turns enemies to gold for a few seconds and causes them to drop 1-4 coins if killed while golden (similar to the Midas' Touch item)
      When the Midas Touch tear effect triggers, it will remove 1 coin from your current total
      The golden tear deals double your tear damage
      The effect can still trigger even if you have no held coins

      "Use with caution"
      Quality: 0
      Upon use, this item deals 9,999,999 damage to all enemies in the room and then kills you 3 seconds later
      This is a single use active item, meaning it is destroyed after using it
      Does not kill both phases of multi-phase bosses like Hush or Ultra Greed
      If used to kill a boss, the kill still counts as a victory for post-it note completion marks, but the run will still get a game over
      Delirium's death animation takes longer than 3 seconds, meaning you will die before it can count as a completion mark. One exception to this is if you are playing as Lazarus or have Lazarus' Rags - you will respawn in the same room and get the kill
      Plan C is 5 times rarer than other items in the same item pool, making it less likely to appear

      Possible stat changes include: +1.0 flat damage, +0.5 tears, +0.2 speed, +0.2 shot speed, +0.5 range, +1.0 luck
      Void does not work on devil deal or shop items unless they have been bought first
      Using Void to absorb items in Boss Rush or Challenge Rooms counts as taking the items and will cause the encounter to start

      Quality: 1
      For every empty red heart container, Isaac gains Damage Up and his body increases in size
      Only works on full hearts - damage does not change if Isaac is missing 1/2 of a heart in one container
      Healing empty red heart containers will remove the damage increases
      Has no effect for The Lost and ???, as they cannot gain red heart containers (except for counting towards the Spun transformation)
      Counts as 1 of 3 syringe items needed towards the Spun transformation
      REPENTANCE - Adrenaline now grants an increasingly higher damage bonus the more empty heart containers Isaac has

      The 10 spawned needles will also deal 3 times your tear damage, but won't instantly kill enemies or explode into more needles
      The chance to for each tear to become a needle is affected by your luck stat and at +15 Luck it will activate every time

      However, if Keeper drops to under 2 health coins as a result of Greed's Gullet, he is unable to use a HP Up to increase his health back to 2, and has to regain the lost coins to do so
